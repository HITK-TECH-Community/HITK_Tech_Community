Hello everyone!😄

Do you wish to become an open source developer but fails to have enough experience or lacks guidance?

Then it's the perfect time to get started as the coding club of NIT Trichy has come up with DWoC - a winter long program.

It aims to support and improve the culture of open source software around us and help young developers to hone their technical skills by taking up projects of their interest.

We hope this encourages collaborative experiences and allows students from all backgrounds to contribute to quality technical projects from diverse fields.👩🏻‍💻🧑🏻‍💻

Thanku,
