Palantir launched the 𝗚𝗹𝗼𝗯𝗮𝗹 𝗜𝗺𝗽𝗮𝗰𝘁 𝗦𝗰𝗵𝗼𝗹𝗮𝗿𝘀𝗵𝗶𝗽 to celebrate and support students from across the globe who are beginning careers in technology. 🥳🎊 We hope to encourage these students in their computer science, engineering, and technical studies, and celebrate their potential to become leaders in these fields. We especially encourage students from communities that are historically underrepresented in the field of technology to apply. 🎯📌
