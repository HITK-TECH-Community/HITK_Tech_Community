Hello folks 😃

The 𝙎𝙬𝙞𝙛𝙩 𝙈𝙚𝙣𝙩𝙤𝙧𝙨𝙝𝙞𝙥 𝙋𝙧𝙤𝙜𝙧𝙖𝙢 is 12 weeks long, designed to encourage developers to actively participate in the 𝙎𝙬𝙞𝙛𝙩 𝙤𝙥𝙚𝙣 𝙨𝙤𝙪𝙧𝙘𝙚 𝙘𝙤𝙢𝙢𝙪𝙣𝙞𝙩𝙮 through direct mentorship with experienced developers. 👩‍🏫👨‍🏫✨ Are you contributing for the first time? No worries, you will first work with your mentor to submit your first patch and overcome any workflow hurdles. The core of the mentorship program is making contributions that work toward the mentee’s learning goals. 📚📈 These contributions can range from implementing a small feature within the project, to several independent bug fixes within the same area of the project. At the end of the mentorship program, mentees’ contributions and learnings will be featured in a dedicated post on the Swift.org blog. 

🎯𝗘𝗹𝗶𝗴𝗶𝗯𝗶𝗹𝗶𝘁𝘆:

🔹Mentees must be anyone of 18 years and older who is willing to learn about Swift. Since this program is designed to encourage and help diverse developers overcome barriers and actively participate in the Swift community, the Diversity in Swift work group strongly encourages members of Women in Swift and Black in Swift to participate. 

🔹Mentors must be members of the Swift community (e.g., iOS developers, Swift compiler contributors, etc). Prior experience with mentorship is a plus, but not required.
