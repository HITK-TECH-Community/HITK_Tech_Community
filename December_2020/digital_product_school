Hello Makers 🙋🏻‍♀️🙋🏻‍♂️
 
Does the idea of building digital product interests you? You can be a part of a great community of digital product makers! 🤩🔥

Digital Product School gives you an opportunity to work in a cross-functional product team, where you can gain professional experience. 🧠💡 As they are user-centric, the teams find solutions to real problems they've validated before. And they rule out bad ideas through experiments. The good ideas are then built in an agile manner.😌✨ And you may not believe it: this also has advantages! Talents who could not come to Munich can now participate.😃 No more trouble with visas anymore. Digital Product School provides higher diversity in the teams! Connecting to users from all over the world is easy. And participants learn for later how remote-work can work. 😇

▪️Plus point is that a stipend upto 750 euros is offered. ✅
