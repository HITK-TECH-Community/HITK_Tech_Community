Hey techies!😃👐🏻

Are you interested in starting your journey in Competitive Coding? So, what are you waiting for? CodeChef December Long Challenge is going on in full swing!

This 10 days contest duration gives one enough time to efficiently tackle a problem by reading the concepts one doesn’t know, and also gain practical experience by coding the solution to the problem, thus improving their skills significantly. 👨🏻‍🏫
