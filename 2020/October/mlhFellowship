Hello Students ✨

At Major League Hacking (MLH), they know the power of hands-on learning first-hand. Every year, more than 100,000 aspiring technologists around the world participate in MLH events where they learn the skills that help them land jobs, launch startups, and everything in between. You can't learn these necessary skills in most classrooms, which is why so many people take their education into their own hands and join our community every year.

MLH Fellowship (Fall 2021) - Open for all undergraduate students aspiring to be a software engineer - 12 week paid internship, where you will be paired with mentors to work on certain projects. 👩🏻‍🏫🧑🏻‍🏫
