Hello there, Tech Enthusiasts! 🙌😎

Do you have the desire to build new things and give back to the community?
Well then we have the perfect platform for you.
If there is one place you can meet and interact with fellow builders, and completely change the trajectory of your careers while in lockdown, it's InOut 7.0.

InOut 7.0 - India's Biggest Community Hackathon is a month long Hackathon in which hackers work in teams & can build whatever they want! 

Work on whatever gives you goosebumps. They don't care if it's software or hardware, non-profit or startup material — it's all up to you.🕺🏻

🗓️ Nov 27 - Dec 21, 2020.

 What's in it for you ❓
🔹With the Build India Fellowship, grant of $10K each will be given to support young builders willing to focus and work on open-source public goods full time for 6 months. The top 5 eligible teams at InOut will skip the application process and directly jump to the interview stage.🤑
🔹Also, the top 100 submissions in it will be getting their limited edition #schwag delivered right to their doorsteps.
